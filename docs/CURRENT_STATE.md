# Current-State Audit

**Audit date:** 2026-10-22  
**Repository:** [Mardakhay/interactive-guides](https://github.com/Mardakhay/interactive-guides)  
**Default branch observed:** `main`

This audit is based on the repository root, source directory listings, current package/config files, the lesson catalog, the renderer and progress-store implementation, selected full HTML lesson files, and recent commit history available through GitHub. It is not a local test run; no claim is made that the current build or tests were executed during this remote audit.

## Existing application

The repository is already a React application, not just a set of HTML files:

- React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS 3
- React Router 6
- Zustand for state
- Zod schemas
- Vitest and Testing Library
- ESLint and GitHub Actions CI

Available scripts from `package.json`:

- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run preview`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:watch`

The current CI workflow runs install, lint, typecheck, tests, and build for pushes and pull requests targeting `main`.

## Existing application features visible in source

- Dashboard
- Course catalog and category details
- Lesson viewer with previous/next navigation
- Lesson completion status and auto-advance behavior
- Bookmarks
- Notes
- Quizzes and saved results
- Search
- Learning paths
- Sidebar and mobile navigation
- Lazy-loaded route pages and route error boundaries
- Schema validation for catalog and progress state
- Local persistence through a small `localStorage` helper
- Some unit tests

The catalog presently declares 25 lessons (IDs spanning `sh-001`, `wb-001…004`, `js-001…004`, `re-001…006`, `ui-001…002`, `tl-001…004`, `qa-001…002`, `sec-001`, and `dt-001`). These categories do not fully represent the 24-week bootcamp sequence in order yet.

## Current content model

`src/data/lessons.json` stores metadata such as ID, title, slug, description, category, difficulty, tags, duration, and order. Its `content` values are empty for the listed lessons.

`src/features/lesson-renderer/lessonLoader.ts` contains a manifest mapping lesson IDs to files in `public/lessons/`. The viewer resolves the manifest and displays content using `LessonRenderer`. `src/features/lesson-renderer/components/ExternalHtmlLesson.tsx` is the current implementation to inspect closely during migration.

There are 25 large standalone HTML content files in `public/lessons/`. The selected samples (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React ecosystem, Git, authentication and deployment) have separate document shells, CSS, typography choices, sidebars/navigation patterns, and visual token sets. That makes them rich source material but not a consistent application-level lesson format. At least some content mixes reference material, deep dives, and guided lessons. The migration should extract and improve their instructional substance, not keep their independent shells as the main user experience.

## Current persistence

The progress store uses `localStorage` and tracks per-lesson status (`not-started`, `in-progress`, `completed`), started/completed timestamps, and the last opened lesson. The generic storage helper catches errors and silently falls back. The current model does not represent section-level reading, individual quiz attempts, coding exercise results, confidence/mastery, spaced repetition, or user-scoped cloud synchronization.

Other features should be inspected before modifying them: bookmarks and notes have their own stores/schema/API modules. Preserve and migrate those records where practical.

## Gaps against the desired product

1. HTML documents are the main content container; there is no single typed, component-rendered lesson schema.
2. Lesson catalog/order is category-oriented rather than a canonical curriculum/program/module/week/lesson hierarchy.
3. Lesson metadata and lesson content are split by a hand-maintained manifest.
4. Current quiz formats need to be audited for explanation quality, coverage, localization and attempt history.
5. English and Russian are not modeled as paired translations at the catalog/content level.
6. Progress is mostly binary per lesson and only local to this browser.
7. There is no documented Supabase authentication/sync design.
8. PWA metadata, install prompt, offline strategy, service-worker cache lifecycle and offline acceptance tests need verification/implementation.
9. Visual styling inside each HTML lesson conflicts with the cohesive application design system.
10. The available course set includes deployment, auth, SQL, and architecture, but should be remapped to the bootcamp syllabus and explicitly mark supplements outside the original bootcamp scope.

## Non-negotiable migration constraints

- Keep the existing `main` history intact.
- Establish a feature branch before large implementation changes.
- Keep `public/lessons/*.html` as migration input until each lesson is extracted, reviewed, translated, validated and linked to its new structured counterpart.
- Do not delete a source lesson simply because a replacement route exists.
- Add data/content contract tests before bulk content migration.
- No service-role key or secret may be shipped to browser code.
- Do not make cloud accounts mandatory for anonymous/local learning.

## Feature-branch verification — 2026-10-23

The active work is on feat/learning-platform-foundation (PR #1), not main. The four SQL/PostgreSQL and production-hosting JSON files exist on this feature branch, but the current app catalog/legacy HTML loader does not register or render those structured files; they are not learner-accessible lessons yet. The catalog remains 25 IDs mapped to 25 English HTML files, not the expected 26 bilingual structured core lessons.

The source audit reconciles 21 fetched Notion pages and 25 HTML files. Notion connector results were marked unverified. Two HTML pages received a full read in the previous pass, with a targeted additional review of the API lesson; the other HTML pages were structurally inspected, not fully audited. Router v6 usage, form-validation/security wording, and API retry caveats were corrected on the feature branch. Current lint, typecheck, build and test evidence is recorded in the session handoff; these focused fixes do not complete curriculum migration or source parity.


## Embedded lesson migration checkpoint — 2026-10-23

Three catalog lessons now have authored content embedded directly in src/data/lessons.json: re-003 (forms and validation), re-004 (API/request lifecycle), and re-005 (shared state and reducers). The lesson loader now prefers non-empty catalog content and uses the iframe mapping only as a migration fallback. This is a partial migration, not a full course conversion: 22 other lesson bodies are still blank and use standalone HTML, and the app has no locale-aware EN/RU lesson pairing. See FULL_SOURCE_CONTENT_AUDIT.md for exact source evidence and gaps.
